# RACI Matrix Template

## Purpose
A RACI matrix clarifies roles and responsibilities by defining who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each project activity or deliverable. This ensures clear accountability and prevents confusion about ownership.

## RACI Definitions

- **R (Responsible)**: Does the work to complete the task. Multiple people can be Responsible.
- **A (Accountable)**: Ultimately answerable for the completion and approval. Only ONE person should be Accountable per task.
- **C (Consulted)**: Provides input and expertise. Two-way communication.
- **I (Informed)**: Kept up-to-date on progress. One-way communication.

## How to Use

1. List key activities/deliverables in rows
2. List roles in columns
3. Assign RACI codes for each intersection
4. Ensure each activity has exactly ONE Accountable person
5. Review and validate with the team during project kickoff

## Tips for Creating Your RACI

- **Start broad, then refine**: Begin with major deliverables, then break down as needed
- **Avoid too many Rs**: If more than 3 people are Responsible, consider breaking the task down
- **One A per row**: Having multiple Accountable parties causes confusion and delays
- **Don't over-consult**: Too many Cs slows down decision-making
- **Review regularly**: Update the RACI as the project evolves and roles shift

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ Multiple people Accountable for the same deliverable  
❌ No one Accountable for a critical activity  
❌ Too many people in Consulted, slowing decisions  
❌ Forgetting to Inform key stakeholders  
❌ Creating the RACI but never referring back to it
