# OctoAcme Templates

## Overview

This directory contains practical templates and checklists to support the OctoAcme project management framework. These templates help teams establish clear roles, responsibilities, and workflows when starting or running projects.

## Available Templates

### [Role Interaction Matrix](./role-interaction-matrix.md)
**Purpose**: Clarify how different roles collaborate throughout the project lifecycle.

**When to Use**: 
- During project kickoff to establish communication patterns
- When onboarding new team members to show collaboration touchpoints
- During retrospectives to identify communication gaps

### [RACI Matrix](./raci-matrix.md)
**Purpose**: Define who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each project activity.

**When to Use**:
- Project initiation to clarify ownership and accountability
- When there's confusion about decision-making authority
- To prevent bottlenecks by identifying too many consulted parties

### [Role Onboarding Checklist](./role-onboarding-checklist.md)
**Purpose**: Help new team members quickly understand their role and get up to speed.

**When to Use**:
- When a new team member joins the project
- During role transitions within the team
- As a reference for what to cover in onboarding meetings

## How to Use These Templates

1. **Copy, don't modify**: Copy the template to your project repository and customize it there. Keep the originals as reference.

2. **Adapt to your context**: These templates provide a starting point. Adjust based on your:
   - Team size and structure
   - Project complexity
   - Organizational culture
   - Tool ecosystem

3. **Review and update**: Revisit templates periodically (e.g., during retrospectives) to ensure they remain accurate and useful.

4. **Share with stakeholders**: Make sure all relevant parties have access and understand how to use these artifacts.

## Tips for Success

✅ **Do:**
- Involve the team in creating and refining these documents
- Keep them up-to-date as the project evolves
- Reference them during meetings and decision-making
- Store them in an accessible location (project wiki, repo, shared drive)

❌ **Don't:**
- Create these documents and never refer back to them
- Make them overly complex or bureaucratic
- Assign accountability to multiple people (especially in RACI)
- Forget to onboard stakeholders on how to use them
